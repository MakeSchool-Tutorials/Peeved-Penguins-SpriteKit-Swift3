Welcome to bonus stage, your challenge should you accept, is to work through the list of challenges and take your game to the next level.

There are no solutions provided and I would encourage you to discuss potential solutions with your fellow students, it's good to collaborate and often results in new exciting directions.

If you have any challenge suggestions, we would love to hear them. Please feedback at the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/MakeSchool-Tutorials/Peeved-Penguins-SpriteKit-Swift3).

It would be a good idea to create a **new branch** in your repo for these challenges.

# The challenge

The current game has no lives, you have infinite penguin ammo. There is no challenge...

> [challenge]
> Implement a game lives system? It might be nice to use the jumping penguins as the representation of these lives.

# Scoring

There is no scoring element!

> [challenge]
> Add a scoring mechanism, you could assign score values to different objects. What about a high score?

# Penguin properties

You have one type of penguin with fixed physics properties, how about a variety of penguins?

> [challenge]
> Can you create different types of penguins with different characteristics?
> **Hint**: You don't need extra GFX, you can always change the color of a sprite, remember you are prototyping ideas.

# More levels

What happens when you kill all of the seals? Nothing... Let's implement a level mechanic and build some new level content.

> [challenge]
> Implement a level mechanic and add at least 1 new level!

# Catapult physics

The catapult arm physics could be improved.

> [challenge]
> Can you create an improved physics shape in code to replace the catapult arm alpha mask. Use this shape to create a better bucket to hold the penguin.

#Summary

Congratulations on completing the bonus stage!
